## Problem Description: 
Many people, especially college students, struggle to properly maintain or manage personal finances and track spending habits. Smaller expenses can add up, leading to it being much more difficult to know or track if money is being lost or saved over time. The Personal Budget Tracker is able to help solve this issue by allowing users to record income and spending, categorize expenses, and properly calculate one's remaining balance. This will further help users create more informed financial decisions and develop much better budgeting habits.
